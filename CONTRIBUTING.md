Sept 2013

This repository provides the latest updated/bug-fixed examples for _21 Recipes for Mining Twitter_ and is guaranteed to contain newer code than what is in the version of the book that you are reading. 

Given the imminent release of [Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition) in Sept 2013 and all of the work that has gone into creating a superior learning experience and codebase after several years of reader feedback, all consumers of the code in this repository are highly encouraged to migrate to the [new repository for the 2nd Edition](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition) by the end of 2013. It is unlikely that this repository will continue to be maintained at all after the end of 2013.

_Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition_ is a superior work to the 1st Edition in nearly every way, and Chapter 9 (entitled "Twitter Cookbook") absorbs and expands upon the original _21 Recipes for Mining Twitter_ and content in this repository. You can even view a [rendered version of the IPython Notebook for Chapter 9](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/master/ipynb/Chapter%209%20-%20Twitter%20Cookbook.ipynb) and see for yourself.

Please do not log issues for the [Mining the Social Web](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition) of the book in this repository. Log them in its repository instead.

Thank you,<br>
Matthew A. Russell
